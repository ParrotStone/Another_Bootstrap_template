    // ========== Showcase-Carousel Section ==========
    //  jQuery Code To Make It Work[screen thingie]
    // ===============================================
    // I did use the code below just as a personal opinion of it[to make the screen looks great as possible on many viewports as possible], it does work by the way that it makes the screen goes dynamic with large/big heights as long as the height align with the width -> [align here means ratio between them allow the screen to take full-width and not to shrink]
    // Calculate available window height to be assigned to the carousel height
    // the '17' is the py-2[.5 rem for each 1 in paddings||margins in Bootstrap and that resolves into 16px when added top && bottom, thus, resulting in '16px'] of the header and the one is the bottom border height of the navigation section, which i removed, and so i updated the value back to '16'
    // It's overall not LIKED[To use jQuery to adjust the heights & widths in your webpages{just my opinion about the subject, it's not a convention}], at least this how i saw it at the time of writing this code[2/26/2019].
    // The code below solves the problem and make it dynamic with each resize to adjust the window height to become full-width aligned with the height & so on...
    function adjustScreenHeight() {
        // Just a breakpoint to start apply the damn styles [I just chose it as it coincides with Bootstrap v4.2 lg screens starting breakpoint]
        // I think there's no need for conditions || checks here since it applies exactly what we want, to adjust the height of the 'showcase-carousel' every time a 'resize' has been done
        if ($(window).width() >= 992) {
            // Calculate remaining height from the navigation & header sections and assign it to the showcase-carousel section for full-width/height thingie...
            const carouselHeight = $(window).height()
                - $('header').height()
                - $('nav.navbar').height() - 16;
